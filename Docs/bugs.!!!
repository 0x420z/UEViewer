? L2 attach sockets: incorrect socket origin - L2 models have e_bone socket, which should be
  near mouch (?) for breath effect etc - it is (in umodel) located above-left of head ...
  ! checked in UT2004: modified socket in UnrealEd, appears correctly in umodel

- HP3:
  - Dimentor: uses paletted Texture with Masked=true, has pink borders when alpha changed

* SDL bug: after Alt+Tab <Alt> key becomes sticky and program will not respond to keyboard; Ctrl key
  may become sticky too

* MercFemaleB: bugs with alpha-texture on head (hear)
  - translocator: same
  - NightMaleB: same
  - TarjaAnim/SuperFemale same, but uses 8-bit alpha!
  ? fix:
    - use texture MipBias
    - change mipmap generation algorithm
    ? check source of "wrong" color on texture borders (alpha 1->0) - may be, incorrect DXT decompression?
  ! to fix: should resort surface triangles taking in account alpha of applied to it texture

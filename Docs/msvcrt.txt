Works with VC7,8,9. But VC7-compiled program has bugs (at least one: no on-screen texts).

Issues:
* GPF when starting exe linked with "oldnames.lib" (not "wdk_oldnames.lib") -- incorrect call of stricmp():
  compiler were generated "call dword ptr ds:[400000]" instead of "call ds:__imp___stricmp"
- makefiles with WDKCRT dependency will not be compatible with standard VC installations
  - try to add wdk_msvcrt_win2000.obj and oldnames.lib into msvcrt.lib
- Has a lot of kernel32.dll function calls from __security_init_cookie() - this function is called from
  mainCRTStartup() and cannot be overrided (unless use own version of this function)
  - check "VC9/crt/src/crtexe.c"
- executable will not need a manifest when linked with msvcrt.dll - can exclude manifest using link.exe
  option "-manifest:no" (VC8+)

Todo:
- needs to specify path to WDK CRT files (add "OLDCRT" option?) (common.project)

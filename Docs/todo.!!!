!! UC2: make Ar.IsUC2() instead of version checking
!! UC2: load animations, textures

Notify.log:
- add "-nolog" switch to disable it
? place notify.log into directory of umodel.exe
- add current date/time, some umodel info (version) and cmdline in a case of crash

ForcedExport handling: should use this information for UE3 package loading:
- loading:
  1) do not load such objects
  2) load such objects from another package
     a) use metadata from another package - ignore local FBulkData structure
     b) use local metadata + external bulk (simply load compressed/uncompressed data block)
  *) done for GOW2 textures
- prevent export/listing of such resources (or list with "forced" flag?)

FONTGEN
! BUG: '&' displayed as '_' (WinAPI feature)
? add pseudographics chars (for material outline)
! combine with Samples/BitmapBuilder (tool for generating .h file)
! place font information into font DATA[] (not #define), this will allow to use few fonts at the
  same time

GENMAKE:
- "OPTIONS" -> CFLAGS + CPPFLAGS (check, how OPTIONS is currently used), and use separate vars
  for compiling C++ and C code
  - have one C++ option for ddslib.c - compiler show warning

? tool to collect full statistics about all available packages: supply "-path", umodel will recurse
  all directories and try to load all files with known extensions (load 'summary' only); after that,
  program will sort all files by package version and display statistics: 'count', 'ver', 'lic_ver'
  (can be useful for updating 'packages.txt')
    ! best idea - place this into 'Samples' or 'Tools' as separate program, which uses my 'Core' and
    'Unreal' libs; possibly - place 'umodel' into similar directory too:
       /Apps
          /Umodel
          /PkgScan
          ...
    * if so, can remove '-check', '-pkginfo' etc from umodel

! UE1 UTexture has AnimNext field
! UMaterialSequence (check 2K4Menus package)
? key to toggle fullscreen with desktop resolution (no way to implement using SDL only?)
  - X.org has SDL_WM_ToggleFullScreen(), and can use USER32 code for Win32
- key to toggle debug text and 3D lines (good for screenshots)

?? TRIBES3:
  ! strange bugs with face (run t.bat, switch to last animation with '[', zoom to face ...)
    ! check this un UnrealEd
    * To fix: should create Moves.BoneIndices[], fill with 'i' and mark 0x1000-flags bones with -1
      ! check PSA generation too (will be buggy) -- require RefPose bones, but no in UMeshAnimation ...
  ! check all meshes, find FlexTracks
  - have unknown texture type (see BitmapMaterial.uc: have compressed normalmaps)
  - packages: not classical directory structure
  - crash (assert) when switching mesh LOD levels
  * BUGS in Tribes3 (have in both umodel in TvEd): mesh ImperialLightJulia, anims 46,137

? when exporting mesh, can create .uc with sockets too (if possible)
! when cannot load some material type, or file is absent - sould at least give ability to list this
  mesh material in "show materials" or "dump" mode (create dummy material, and use default texture
  in its Bind() - in this case, default material itself is not needed)

! use my GL_Bind tool to dynamically link to OpenGL (allows extension loading)

! packages have tree-like structure of objects, should use whole tree to map export->import (use
  package's "package" field recursively; note: depth can be any)
  * load proper package
  - use object with the same path (problem: how to pass object path to search?)
? change alternative skin (team color for UT2) - in separate tool, "uplayer" - player model viewer
  (UT, UT2004, Lineage2, later - UT3)

! UObject:
  - EndLoad():
    1) sort by package/offset; priority for CURRENT package
    2) add assert before serialization: should not be already loaded (bool flag for UObject)
  - add 2 global lists: complete objects and objects, required serialization; use
    bool flag to check, which list holds object

Exporting:
- TextBuffer export (separate tool?)
  - will require to get defaultproperties from "Class'Name'.properties" (object with name=ClassName and
    class name="")
- option to enable paths when exporting objects (will create directory for each group)

Loading:
- add profiling for loading
- ensure "whole package" loaded using locks (load all top-level objects, then subobjects)
- periodically sort object list before serialization
- profile "recurse.sh" before and after modifications (few times, with and w/o output redirection)
- try to load from CD (slow random access)

- try to compile with MinGW
- move new Math3D parts to Quake2 core (more code to move ?)


REST TO IMPLEMENT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- VertexMesh:
  ? tweening
  ? LOD support
- SkeletalMesh:
  ? hardware skinning (but: Lineage2 has meshes with more than 256 bones)


NOTES:
~~~~~~
- check XGame/Classes/SpeciesType.uc + Species_*.uc -- setting many properties for
  player model
- system/*.upl: files, containing links between meshes/skins/voices/names/portraits etc
  http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/UPL_File
- 2K4_NvidiaIntro has animation+model to be the same names, different types only
  * used from MOV-UT2004-Intro.ut2
- q2 model axis: forward/left/up (?); q2 world axis: forward/right/up (?); ut model axis
  is right/forward/up


COMPLEX MATERIALS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- AW-2k4XP.Weapons.ShockShieldFinal
                   ShockShieldShaftFallbackFinal
- AW-ShieldShaders.Shaders.BlueShieldFinal - has nested Combiners

                   HUD.fbBombFocus
                   SPMenu.SP_FinalButton (has combiner with const color)

                        LinkGunYellowShader
                        PowerPulseShaderYellow
- WarEffectsTextures.Particles.N_energy01_S_JM (Shader uses FinalBlend; simple)
- XEffectMat.goop.GoopFB (has Shader -> Modifier -> Combiner)
- XGameTextures.SuperPickups.DOMMabRs
                             DOMScreens
                             HealthPackTexS

SIMPLE MODIFIERS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- check HUDContent package
- PickupSkins.Shaders.ShieldFinal
- ULogo.MainMenu.CornerMenuFinal (UT menu slideshow)
- UT2004Weapons.Shaders.ShockHitShader
                WeaponSpecMap2 (used as specular overlay for rocket launcher)
- VMVehicle-TX.VehicleExplosions.GENERICshrapnelTEX
               Environments.ReflectionEnv (envmap using single texture)
- WeaponSkins.Skins.SniperScreen1C

Notes:
- it is possible, that Shader will have same object in Diffuse and SelfIllumination fields -
  - can ignore Diffuse here? (really, such shaders require SelfIllumination only, but UE
  requires non-null Diffuse, otherwise 'white' will be displayed)


COMMON MATERIAL USE TREE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FinalBlend
  -> Shader
     -> Combiner(s)
       -> Modifier (any count)
         -> Texture
         -> Modifier (const color)

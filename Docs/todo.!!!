StaticMesh:
- build tangent space

Extract.exe:
? add "-zip" option: convert package to uncompressed zip file
- add options for browsing package contents with 'FAR Manager MultiArc'

Shaders: when trying to change/compile shader between glBegin/glEnd, GL will not do anything.
Should check glGetError() and assert? (or make function GL_CheckError() - will appError(code)
if code != 0)

FArchive:
? ArVer, ArLicenseeVer -> Ver(), LicenseeVer() + hide these fields

Settings.ini (umodel.cfg, different name ?)
- background (gradient) color
- disable GL2
- disable bloom (if one)
- disable notify.log
? disable log at all
- extra (default) command line switches
- disable viewing of axis in 3D
- default lighting mode
- initial window size
- custom package extensions
- custom directories to export data (now: ${Package}/${Class}/${Object}, before: ${Package}/${Object} etc)

Notify.log:
- add "-nolog" switch to disable it
? place notify.log into directory of umodel.exe
- add current date/time, some umodel info (version) and cmdline in a case of crash

ForcedExport handling: should use this information for UE3 package loading:
- prevent export/listing of such resources (or list with "forced" flag?)

FONTGEN
! BUG: '&' displayed as '_' (WinAPI feature)
? add pseudographics chars (for material outline)
! combine with Samples/BitmapBuilder (tool for generating .h file)
! place font information into font DATA[] (not #define), this will allow to use few fonts at the
  same time

GENMAKE:
- "OPTIONS" -> CFLAGS + CPPFLAGS (check, how OPTIONS is currently used), and use separate vars
  for compiling C++ and C code
  - have one C++ option for ddslib.c - GCC compiler show warning

! UE1 UTexture has AnimNext field
! implement UMaterialSequence (check 2K4Menus package)
? key to toggle fullscreen with desktop resolution (no way to implement using SDL only?)
  - X.org has SDL_WM_ToggleFullScreen(), and can use USER32 code for Win32
- key to toggle debug text and 3D lines (good for screenshots)

?? (check, possibly fixed) TRIBES3:
  ! strange bugs with face (run t.bat, switch to last animation with '[', zoom to face ...)
    ! check this un UnrealEd
    * To fix: should create Moves.BoneIndices[], fill with 'i' and mark 0x1000-flags bones with -1
      ! check PSA generation too (will be buggy) -- require RefPose bones, but no in UMeshAnimation ...
  - skeletal mesh LOD levels - has visual bugs on most LOD meshes
  * BUGS in Tribes3 (have in both umodel in TvEd): mesh ImperialLightJulia, anims 46,137

? when exporting mesh, can create .uc with sockets too (if possible)
  - requires conversion FCoords -> FVector+FRotator
! when cannot load some material type, or file is absent - sould at least give ability to list this
  mesh material in "show materials" or "dump" mode (create dummy material, and use default texture
  in its Bind() - in this case, default material itself is not needed)

! packages have tree-like structure of objects, should use whole tree to map export->import (use
  package's "package" field recursively; note: depth can be any)
  * load proper package
  - use object with the same path (problem: how to pass object path to search?)
? change alternative skin (team color for UT2) - in separate tool, "uplayer" - player model viewer
  (UT, UT2004, Lineage2, later - UT3)

! UObject:
  - EndLoad():
    1) sort by package/offset; priority for CURRENT package
    2) add assert before serialization: should not be already loaded (bool flag for UObject)
  - add 2 global lists: complete objects and objects, required serialization; use
    bool flag to check, which list holds object
  - periodically sort object list before serialization
    - profile "recurse.sh" before and after modifications (few times, with and w/o output redirection)
    - testing: try to load from CD (slow random access)

Exporting (typeinfo tool?):
- TextBuffer export
  - will require to get defaultproperties from "Class'Name'.properties" (object with name=ClassName and
    class name="")

- try to compile with MinGW (checked GCC4 from cygwin, 7.10.2010 - gcc4 has no "-mno-cygwin" switch)
- move new Math3D parts to Quake2 core (more code to move ?)
- add 3rd party library names/links/licenses to readme.txt


NOTES:
~~~~~~
- check XGame/Classes/SpeciesType.uc + Species_*.uc -- setting many properties for
  player model
- system/*.upl: files, containing links between meshes/skins/voices/names/portraits etc
  http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/UPL_File
- 2K4_NvidiaIntro has animation+model to be the same names, different types only
  * used from MOV-UT2004-Intro.ut2
- q2 model axis: forward/left/up (?); q2 world axis: forward/right/up (?); ut model axis
  is right/forward/up


COMPLEX MATERIALS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- AW-2k4XP.Weapons.ShockShieldFinal
                   ShockShieldShaftFallbackFinal
- AW-ShieldShaders.Shaders.BlueShieldFinal - has nested Combiners
- DeRez.Shaders.DeRezFinalHead
- EpicParticles.Shaders.FireFinal
- InterfaceContent.Logos.fbSymbolShader (UT menu logo)
                   HUD.fbBombFocus
                   SPMenu.SP_FinalButton (has combiner with const color)
- MenuEffects.ScoreBoard.ScoreboardU_FB (alternative UT logo)
- PickupSkins.Shaders.FinalHealthCore
                      FinalDamShader
- UT2004Weapons.Shaders.BlueShockFinal
                        PurpleShockFinal (complex, nested Combiners)
                        LinkGunYellowShader
                        PowerPulseShaderYellow
- WarEffectsTextures.Particles.N_energy01_S_JM (Shader uses FinalBlend; simple)
- XEffectMat.goop.GoopFB (has Shader -> Modifier -> Combiner)
- XGameTextures.SuperPickups.DOMMabRs
                             DOMScreens
                             HealthPackTexS

SIMPLE MODIFIERS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- check HUDContent package
- PickupSkins.Shaders.ShieldFinal
- ULogo.MainMenu.CornerMenuFinal (UT menu slideshow)
- UT2004Weapons.Shaders.ShockHitShader
                WeaponSpecMap2 (used as specular overlay for rocket launcher)
- VMVehicle-TX.VehicleExplosions.GENERICshrapnelTEX
               Environments.ReflectionEnv (envmap using single texture)
- WeaponSkins.Skins.SniperScreen1C

Notes:
- it is possible, that Shader will have same object in Diffuse and SelfIllumination fields -
  - can ignore Diffuse here? (really, such shaders require SelfIllumination only, but UE
  requires non-null Diffuse, otherwise 'white' will be displayed)


COMMON MATERIAL USE TREE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FinalBlend
  -> Shader
     -> Combiner(s)
       -> Modifier (any count)
         -> Texture
         -> Modifier (const color)

FONTGEN
! BUG: '&' displayed as '_' (WinAPI feature)
? add pseudographics chars (for material outline)

?? TRIBES3:
  ! strange bugs with face (run t.bat, switch to last animation with '[', zoom to face ...)
    ! check this un UnrealEd
    * To fix: should create Moves.BoneIndices[], fill with 'i' and mark 0x1000-flags bones with -1
      ! check PSA generation too (will be buggy) -- require RefPose bones, but no in UMeshAnimation ...
  ! check all meshes, find FlexTracks
  - have unknown texture type (see BitmapMaterial.uc: have compressed normalmaps)
  - packages: not classical directory structure
  - crash (assert) when switching mesh LOD levels
  * BUGS in Tribes3 (have in both umodel in TvEd): mesh ImperialLightJulia, anims 46,137

! implement socket support (visualization)
? support Undying
! when cannot load some material type, or file is absent - sould at least give ability to list this
  mesh material in "show materials" or "dump" mode (create dummy material, and use default texture
  in its Bind() - in this case, default material itself is not needed)

! use my GL_Bind tool to dynamically link to OpenGL (allows extension loading)

! options for:
  - option to toggle lighting
  ? option to toggle texturing
! packages have tree-like structure of objects, should use whole tree to map export->import (use
  package's "package" field recursively; note: depth can be any)
  * load proper package
  - use object with the same path (problem: how to pass object path to search?)
- change alternative skin (?)

! UObject:
  - EndLoad():
    1) sort by package/offset; priority for CURRENT package
    2) add assert before serialization: should not be already loaded (bool flag for UObject)
  - add 2 global lists: complete objects and objects, required serialization; use
    bool flag to check, which list holds object

Exporting:
- TextBuffer export
  - will require to get defaultproperties from "Class'Name'.properties" (object with name=ClassName and
    class name="")
- option to enable paths when exporting objects (will create directory for each group)

Loading:
- add profiling for loading
- ensure "whole package" loaded using locks (load all top-level objects, then subobjects)
- periodically sort object list before serialization
- profile "recurse.sh" before and after modifications (few times, with and w/o output redirection)
- try to load from CD (slow random access)

- try to compile with MinGW
- move new Math3D parts to Quake2 core


REST TO IMPLEMENT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- VertexMesh:
  - tweening
  ? LOD support
- SkeletalMesh:
  - correctly display LOD models (with skinning)
  - hardware skinning


EXTRA KEYS:
~~~~~~~~~~~
- show boxes
  ? no boxes in UT2 (reserved, but not used)


NOTES:
~~~~~~
- check XGame/Classes/SpeciesType.uc + Species_*.uc -- setting many properties for
  player model
- system/*.upl: files, containing links between meshes/skins/voices/names/portraits etc
  http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/UPL_File
- 2K4_NvidiaIntro has animation+model to be the same names, different types only
  * used from MOV-UT2004-Intro.ut2
- q2 model axis: forward/left/up (?); q2 world axis: forward/right/up (?); ut model axis
  is right/forward/up


COMPLEX MATERIALS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- AW-2k4XP.Weapons.ShockShieldFinal
                   ShockShieldShaftFallbackFinal
- AW-ShieldShaders.Shaders.BlueShieldFinal - has nested Combiners
- DeRez.Shaders.DeRezFinalHead
- EpicParticles.Shaders.FireFinal
- InterfaceContent.Logos.fbSymbolShader (UT menu logo)
                   HUD.fbBombFocus
                   SPMenu.SP_FinalButton (has combiner with const color)
- MenuEffects.ScoreBoard.ScoreboardU_FB (alternative UT logo)
- PickupSkins.Shaders.FinalHealthCore
                      FinalDamShader
- UT2004Weapons.Shaders.BlueShockFinal
                        PurpleShockFinal (complex, nested Combiners)
                        LinkGunYellowShader
                        PowerPulseShaderYellow
- WarEffectsTextures.Particles.N_energy01_S_JM (Shader uses FinalBlend; simple)
- XEffectMat.goop.GoopFB (has Shader -> Modifier -> Combiner)
- XGameTextures.SuperPickups.DOMMabRs
                             DOMScreens
                             HealthPackTexS

SIMPLE MODIFIERS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- check HUDContent package
- PickupSkins.Shaders.ShieldFinal
- ULogo.MainMenu.CornerMenuFinal (UT menu slideshow)
- UT2004Weapons.Shaders.ShockHitShader
                WeaponSpecMap2 (used as specular overlay for rocket launcher)
- VMVehicle-TX.VehicleExplosions.GENERICshrapnelTEX
               Environments.ReflectionEnv (envmap using single texture)
- WeaponSkins.Skins.SniperScreen1C

Notes:
- it is possible, that Shader will have same object in Diffuse and SelfIllumination fields -
  - can ignore Diffuse here? (really, such shaders require SelfIllumination only, but UE
  requires non-null Diffuse, otherwise 'white' will be displayed)


COMMON MATERIAL USE TREE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FinalBlend
  -> Shader
     -> Combiner(s)
       -> Modifier (any count)
         -> Texture
         -> Modifier (const color)

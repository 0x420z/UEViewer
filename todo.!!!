Animation:
- realtime playback
- looped animation playback

Mesh:
- display as wireframe
- deform with skeleton

! UObject:
  - EndLoad(): use 'while (GObjLoaded.Num())'
    1) sort by package/offset; priority for CURRENT package
    2) if object was not created (not found or unknown class) - should not try to do
       it again (infinite loop possible!) -- create dummy object?
    3) add assert before serialization: should not be already loaded (bool flag for UObject)
  - add 2 global lists: complete objects and objects, required serialization; use
    bool flag to check, which list holds object

* 2K4_NvidiaIntro has animation+model to be the same names, different types only
  * used from MOV-UT2004-Intro.ut2

! skeleton is inverted
  * note: q2 model axis: forward/left/up (?); q2 world axis: forward/right/up (?); ut model axis
    is right/forward/up
! rigid parts are not displayed in LOD mode
? X-axis (red) should look at viewer; now - looking forward (should negate X axis)
! should rotate/offset models
? VertMesh: choose glCull mode -- impossible? (skaarj model: have single-side polys)
  ? from UnrealEd: all vertex meshes uses no backface culling, but skeletal meshes uses culling
  ! 'FinalBlend' class has property 'bool TwoSided', which is 'true' in described situation


EXTRA KEYS:
~~~~~~~~~~~
- show boxes
- show skeleton: none, bones, bones+names


NOTES:
~~~~~~
- check XGame/Classes/SpeciesType.uc + Species_*.uc -- setting many properties for
  player model
- system/*.upl: files, containing links between meshes/skins/voices/names/portraits etc

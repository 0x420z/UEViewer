- HP3:
  - Dimentor: uses paletted Texture with Masked=true, has pink borders when alpha changed

- sometimes after relatively long time of application inactivity, program becomes inresponsible to
  keyboard and mouse (should press Ctrl+Shift? but why even ESC does not works?)

* MercFemaleB: bugs with alpha-texture on head (hear)
  - translocator: same
  - NightMaleB: same
  - TarjaAnim/SuperFemale same, but uses 8-bit alpha!
  ? fix:
    - use texture MipBias
    - change mipmap generation algorithm
    ? check source of "wrong" color on texture borders (alpha 1->0) - may be, incorrect DXT decompression?
  ! to fix: should resort surface triangles taking in account alpha of applied to it texture

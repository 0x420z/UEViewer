* MercFemaleB: bugs with alpha-texture on head (hear)
  - translocator: same
  - NightMaleB: same
  - TarjaAnim/SuperFemale same, but uses 8-bit alpha!
  ? fix:
    - use texture MipBias
    - change mipmap generation algorithm
    ? check source of "wrong" color on texture borders (alpha 1->0) - may be, incorrect DXT decompression?

to fix: should resort surface triangles taking in account alpha of applied to it texture
